            <div id="who">The Psychology of Berserk:</div>

                    
            <div class="row">                
                <div class="column">
                    <h4 class="cabecalhoReal">Casual</h4>
                    <p class="paragrafo2">The tale of Berserk reveals the darkest aspects about humanity, and while having evil demons added on to the narrative, 
                        mankind is the usually the one who gives the impresion of evil during the story: it's humanity that starts wars, rapes, 
                        pillages and leaves children for death(very much like our actual world). Berserk's humanity is and always has been at it's 
                        lowest, and while thre's much more evil to be percieved after the rise of the demons, during the golden age arc with the 
                        warring kingdoms, cruelty has still very present through carnal sins and political betrayals. All the viewers are seeing during the tale 
                        is battle: Guts, our main protagonist, is the focal point in a massive war between nations. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">Our own world has seen far greater than anything exibited in Berserk, but by the time the Black Swordsman Arc arrives, 
                        we full well understand the dept of humanity's depravity. When Guts is not focused in war, we can see humans natural state succumbing to 
                        every form of evil; the religious use religion itself as disguise to do evil, while the non-religious see no reason to avoid evil. 
                        
                        It's the bleakest of world: a bleak, opressed world happy to look up to whatever Messiah would come and support there lack of justice. 
                        The pure antithesis to Guts, Griffith the White Hawk is that becon of hope, misconstrued hope but hope nevertheless in a depraved world 
                        where there is no other light to be found. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p class="paragrafo2">
                        All that been said, none of that is in the spotlight in the slightless;  we're looking at Guts and his jouney, 
                        while the background everywhere gives us the notion of darkness in humanity, our focuses is on something else entirely. 
                        Guts sees humanity for what it is, despite making no moves to save the day, he has his own ambitions in mind, 
                        and almost everthing we see him do through out the Black Swordsman Arc is done do to necessity. Both humans and 
                        demons he comes across are merely obstacles to his goals, so therefore while understanding what they are, he makes no means to change them.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">
                        Guts isn't out to be a hero for the public to admire. All the fans are sured to be thrilled at the few moments that that actually 
                        happens, but to our main hero that's proven to be completely useless. Guts has discarded claps just like he discarded honor, 
                        because none of that is real; it's merely a state of mind due to one's current perspective, so by the time the Black Swordsman Arc arrives, 
                        Guts had already seen all the eye can see: the depravity in humans, the presence of evil within demons, and he sees where he stands in the 
                        greater world he inhabits. From where we stand now in the story development, Guts's eyes only see the truth; fighting a battle honorably 
                        is for fools, a naive tactic to scape the reality of the acts one's committing, that been only inherently dishonest. Using a religion 
                        as a disguise for either murder or pacifism because of the power it has is no service of God, it's just a ugly lie. But while Mozgus is 
                        just a massive sadist, he'll lie to himself and to the world that killing foes with by all means, is the will of God. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="paragrafo2">
                        The world tackles with dishonesty around our protagonist, and its not just shown in mere humans, and Guts's already sees the world 
                        in the black and white mode that it presents in, as does Griffith, but in complete contrast to Guts's ideals. 
                        Guts outward character design is one of excessive savagery and entrenched in deep, shadowing and overdone black like 
                        no other "good guy" in ficction, yet despite the evil seeming exterior, inwardly he's the purest of protagonists. In the 
                        flip side we have Griffith, outwardly, he's the most serene, elegant angelic character design ever, and he is regarded by 
                        the entire world as the Messiah; he's someone who's commited the most atrocious of acts, and he's  the most evil being in the 
                        world, if not in all ficction. Despite that, it is not the message he gives to the world while gathering up his army and devout followers. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">
                        As shown, judging either Guts or Griffith by their cover is a really bad move wich results only in narrative confusion for the reader. 
                        Griffith at the current time in the manga is living a facade, bathing in false outward apperances, while Guts discards apperances and 
                        embraces the beast that resides within, the one every human being tries all life to surpress. Griffith is the complete antithesis to 
                        Guts as mentioned before, because his entire being is composed and thrives of dishonesty and falsehood while Guts only sees truth and reality. 
                        
                        This is certainly on of the major deeds of Miuras tale, despite never getting to se anyone talking about it in the story, wich we will be coming back 
                        to discuss why after stressing the importance of Guts's extreme humanity to the plot. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">
                        Guts does not talk a lot to other characters as he also doesn't create monologues, yet his resolve and psychology become more 
                        and more clear as the story progresses, and that's because Guts has problaly what can be described as the wrost life ever. 
                        
                        And though been a life wich none of us will ever come close to ever dream of having, he remainsas one of the most realiable 
                        characters ever to exist. It's almost paradoxical, yet the motive behind it not that complex: More then any other character 
                        from any other story, Guts is really human; on a visual perspective, reading the masterpiece of a manga that is Berserk reminded 
                        day in and day out of this people state as a mere human, constantly sworn by the allies of darkness we don't know how he will defeat, 
                        turning down even the Demon King of Kushan's Empire invitation to ally up against Griffith, only to retain his humanity.  
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">
                        Guts will retain his human state by all cost, but this is so far just a superfical glance at the mechanics of Berserk narrative. 
                        Taking a look at the Eclipse, the turinig point of our story, the two survivors here Guts and Casca, and as a result of that both 
                        of them had their respective philosophies massively affected, but very diferently. Casca was violated mentally and physically, 
                        watching a world she didn't know that existed devour all her closest friends and experiencing a side of Griffith, her savior, 
                        she wouldn't have believed existed as he raped her in front of the one she loved. She was destroyed, her mind was completely 
                        overloaded by the situation at hand, and all this resulted in her losing her mind past the Golden Age Arc. The issue here is people often 
                        claim something very simmilar happened to Guts; that he was also emotionally and psychologically shredded, therefore destroying his 
                        sense of morality and lingering humanity also. This is a strong disagree I have with most of Berserk readers: For me, this was exacly here 
                        Guts grabed hold of his humanity, embracing his human pain of loss succumbing to the human sin of wrath.
