            <div class="row">                
                <div class="column">
                    <h4 class="cabecalhoReal">Eclipsed</h4>
                    <p class="paragrafo2">"Griffith did nothing wrong" would be the main focus of all existing discussions over the actions 
                        that took place in Berserk, mainly during the Eclipse. The problem is, most analysis on this subject
                        tend to revolve over one unique question: "Do the end justify the means?", in this case, was it worth
                        Griffith sacrificing his loyal friends comrades to create Falconia?. 

                        The philosofical dillema that is discussed in this questioning is both really deep and interesting, however, 
                        taking a very long time thinking about it, I see that it seems not to apply in this situation, in the way people discuss it at least.
                        Griffith is the ultimate antithesis to Guts, wich plays out in so many ideological fashions, its almost impossible
                        to think that this whole history was written by one person.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">Labeling Guts ultimate atributes, I would say the steadfast grasp opf humanity, despite the forces pulling 
                        him astray, and the vision of a honest reality, no matter how grusome, make a clear definition of the man.
                        And at the same time, this are the two atributes Griffith discards fundamentaly, hi's eager to abadon his 
                        humanity for power, and he believes honest reality to be the ultime naive a tee. He's opperated via deception
                        back in the golden age arc, and even now, in his reborn state, he adorns his flag as a messiah, and his angelic
                        serenity, is the ultimate facade to his actual identity. Hi's cloathed in lies, where's Guts gives absolutely no
                        pretext of false appearances.

                        The conclusion of both my first and second Berserk readthrough is that Griffith is in fact a fascinating character,
                        and no, it's not because he beleives in the philosophy that the ends justify the means. As I genuinely beleive, 
                        simplicity is the hardest thing to master, and Griffith proves me right on all fronts. The claim to the fact that 
                        Griffith reasoning must be "the ends justify the means" comes solely from an outsider looking at Griffith's actions.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p class="paragrafo2">As the readers know he did bad things and right now humanity lives in a paradise, therefore the ends do justify the
                        means, is the argument of a significative part of the fandom. But the narrative surrouding Griffith goes way 
                        beyond that, and character psychology helps to understand that, painting his actions in a different light that may 
                        otherwise be perceived from the outside.

                        Griffth is the epidemy of the insatiable, he's power hungry and will stop at nothing to grow in status and strenght,
                        and this is clear. He addmits seeing the Band of the Hawk as his tools, he'll screw anyone foi political power
                        (literally), he loved princess Charlotte for her rank not for individual personality, and being a man of commom 
                        birth, he decided he'd become someone of importance. This is how he was introduced to the history of the manga,
                        and every manipulative ploy was for this one goal. In the interity of the series, until his breaking point, 
                        everything went his way, big or small. On the psycological scope, when someone gets everything they want, they 
                        develope a compliccy complex, and their ego grows to the point of no return, where everthing must go there way.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">We can see this kind of behavior in Bakugou from "Boku no Hero Academia", he had everthing he wanted, untill he
                        didn't. Bakugou, who was always te special one lost what made him special, and he went completly mad, just like 
                        Guts abbandoned Griffith and he also went insane. And going a deeper analysis, we can see that the Bakugou
                        psycological meltdown is far lighter, once he inicialy held the goal of becoming the "Number 1 Hero", so despite
                        being wrenched out of his confort zone, his self imposed purpose was not taken away, as it was and still is is 
                        his grasp, even when the league of villains tried to taunt him into to becoming a villain, he was steadfast in his
                        ideology of becoming a hero, while Griffith... Was a little bit different.
                     </p>

                     <p class="paragrafo2">"The White Hawk", an undefeated living legend, never had a set benchmark goal whatsoever, and that was precisely
                        what made his figure so terryfiying. Most of the mainstream villains have the goal to tak over [ T H E  W O R L D ],
                        while griffith doesn´t. He's just never satisfied where he's at, making his sights constantly 
                        set themselves higher and higher. So back to Bakugou, while his goal is still fulfillable therefore 
                        making him able to keep it together, Griffith losing Guts destroyed him.
                    </p> 

                    <p class="paragrafo2">Not just the brawn that went along with Guts when he left, but his complaisant mentality of constant-consistent 
                        growth was shattered with Guts anuncing his departure, and was further destoyed when Guts handly defeated him in a duel, clearly
                        surpassing him, even though Griffith was more powerfull in their last match. Much like the overdeveloping 
                        spoiled brat he was, he then lead his frustration out to attempt to replace what he'd lost, and the way he found
                        to be the best in time, was fucking the princess(really bad move).
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragrafo2">That was the end of human Griffith. 
                        Thematically, every action he takes makes complete sense under the psycological outlines that have been
                        mentioned so far, and so does the eclipse: He metaphorically climbed the mountain of his ally corpses to reach
                        new heights, the manga pointed that out plainly, and that's why he had his allys all along.
                        This is the main explanation that can pretty much explain Griffith's mindset post and 
                        during the events of the eclipse.
                        Pushing the "ends justify the means" down your own throat after deeply analyzing the main course of events
                        in Beserk is nothing more than trying to hard to make Griffith a far more morally ambiguous person than he 
                        actually is.
                        Now thatthe tables have been dealt, comes the second part of the explanation, showing why Griffith is one of the
                        greatest villians known to fiction, whether is was realized consciously or not.
                        To get in the right mindset, you need to forget about Golden Age Griffith for a bit, cause the truth of the matter
                        is, our perception of Griffith himself is obviously greatly affected by the monstrosities he has comitted in the
                        past.

                        Griffith confronts the reamaing midland army generals and claims he must become the leader, been that the only possible way to victory. Needless to say, the generals were not pleased that someone of common birth would ever proprose such a thing. One after another, everthing fell into place: simultaneously, princess declared Griffith as her bethroved, the children of the city had dreams of a glimouring white hawk piercing the darkness, and the pope himself at that moment arrived and fully prostrated before Griffith, declaring him to be the savior of the world. This was enough to make the midland army give him control over everything and everyone. The Kushan Emprire was the new world power, and something needed to be done, and was this common born beacon of hope that could do the job. Hope for everyone in the world, but especially hope for someone born not to nobility. And so, Griffith became the benevolent ruler of the allied forces, his serene grace and charismatic silence was defining; he was the one that could bring redeption for Midland, but it wasn't that easy. Even every soldier in the allied forces wouldn't be enough to take the supernatural oponent they were coming to face, if we're thiking of the old wave lenght. Something really unusual about Griffith is that he's the antithesis to Guts, his major ocurrent attributes through out the entire thematic narrative were his disregard of humanity and facade desonest reality, the're the two aspects that are literally the ideologic makeup of Griffith in the grand scaled tale of Berserk, but looking at Griffith post-apocalipse only, what exactly are his two ultimate defining attributes? 
This common born, alleged human doesn't believe and will not conform to nobility; Griffith is the one to lead and will not concur with the deception that nobility makes someone of greater value, in fact, that entire misconception must be destroyed. Further more, the essence of humanity is the acceptance that everyone is different, and the acceptance of everyone, whether if its a diference in status as far as how the're born, mentally, of phisically. But why does that has to apply only to humans as a species? Believing humanity uses "humanity" as a ideology and not literally, all races should be treated equally, whether humans or other sentient beings, and that's the ideology Griffith pushes. In his final battle with Kushan, he requires drawing assistance from humanity and demon kind: only humans and apostles working together could overcome this vast threat, and they do. For the first time is history, this seemingly opposing races were uniting under the same flag, fighting the same battle and following the same ideology.

Griffith caused the ultimate peace, via destoying discrimination at it's core. He embraced the hiphotesis that demons and humans can coexist and made a reality out of it, creating the super-nation of Falconia, stressing the importance of individuality and not discriminating  against one another, despite beeing seemingly sworn enemies by fate. Looking once again, at the Midland  scenario  post-eclipse only, Griffith is the most kind hearted, selfless, benevolent ruler the world has ever known in it's tragic, formerly dark history, and the world was at last seemingly shed in a powerfull possibility of eternal ilumination, which are the same exact attributes Guts's middle narrative contains; they're the same two attributes that are the antithesis to full story Griffith, but if you're only looking at post-apocalipse, the entire history reverses, and those two attributes that in reality are the antithesis to Griffith, just getting half a history, they´re the embodiment of Griffith; and as for my personal opinion, reading Berserk would that perspective is unquantifiably terrifying.

Having thematically definied Griffith's character it's now possible to better discuss about Berserk legendary ambiguity and were the infamous "do the ends justify the means" line really falls into place, very much not what I expected before re-reading the manga, but I strongly believe my interpretation to be fairly accurate, and that question is "What do we do now?". The way Griffith has been written looking at the full story is that he's the main villain of the narrative, he's done more then enough of his fair share of evil, and he's clearly the thematic nemisis to Guts, who absolutely plays the role of our main hero. That been said, from a narrative perspective, we should all be routing for Griffith's domise; now that statement is purely the perspective perpetuated by the narrative, and a very objetcive one at that, as I've mentioned, coming to the story only looking at Griffith post Eclipse, we'd be seeing him as the God send savior the world desperatly needed. This wonderfull actions he's done only become the facade retroactively once is in the perspective of the greater tale, where all the good and truth advocades forward, making those same actions become the epidemy of evil, but that in on itselft is a fascinating question: If someone's actions are good, an there mindset is evil, is that person evil? And the answer to that question would be yes, he as an individual is an evil dude, but the follow-up question is when things get scary: Is a bad thing he's evil? If he's only doing good for everyone, like Griffith is doing right now, why should we care about his evil centered intentions? Because, whether you like it or not, the outcome is he's doing good. 
This is trully where we there "do the ends justify the means" line applies to Griffith, with the ends beeing his actions, wich are good, and the means beeing his mentality, wich is evil.

With that said, we have enough groundwork to now talk about the fascinating ambiguity between Guts and Griffith that remained as one of the driving forces of Berserk’s  entire tale. We have Guts, the most human character in manga history ever, a flawless written flawed character; no one ever claimed he was a justice seeker, some claim he's a man whos's seen too much and lost all morality, yet they are all deadly mistaken, and the explanation for that statement is found at Guts psychological analysis wich you should have read before this  (though you can read read right after and still get the whole ideia). As is known is the Berserk saga, Guts is out for Griffith's blood and no explantion is required as to why he may not want to shake hands and make friends with the guy the betrayed and wiped out everyone close to him, tried to kill Guts himself and then raped his loved one in front of him  while keeping eye contact with Guts the whole time, point been that a human like me or you or Guts would have probably all  reacted in a similar way if possible. It´'s a solid justification from a narrative standpoint as far as writting a human character, as it very much fits Guts's theme perfectly as well, been the "ultimate human" that Miura tried his best to develop, and the seeker for truth and reality. 
Now, having discussed the emotive fraction of the problematic, lets talk racional: Would killing Griffith really benefit the world at this point? At the present moment in the story he's still an evil being, but his evilness is internal;  externally the world definitely needs him, so would Guts actually be in the right to kill him if he can? Does the ends been killing the infamous Hawk of Darkness justify the means that is taking away from the world the savior, facade or not? Every brilliant moral standpoint in the tale in the series ends up been aplied to both sides, and despite how much we bonce these ideals back and forth and embrace the eppic ambiguity of right and wrong, the narrative, the narrative tells us that justice is on Guts's side; structurally Guts is gonna be victorious( if we ever get there). Till this point only God himself knows how overpowered Griffith is, but that's irrelevant to the philosofy of the story, but is Guts actually wins, that alone will be the so expected answer to this brilliant-ambiguous moral charade. 
Griffith's power hungry insatiable mentality must be put to an end, regardless of the wonderfull deeds he's done, because of the living threat he presents to all life on Midland; his hunger will not be satisfied with merely becoming the supreme ruler of humanity, and as we know, he treats his subjects as pawns and steping stones to his nxt goal. There's nothing stoping an ethical monster from commitng monstrous acts, regardless of the wonderfull yet obviously self-benefited actions he's currently doing. This is not saying a bad person can't change, anyone can change,but Griffith is not trying to change; at the end of the day, he's still trying to manipulate humans and demons indiscriminately. Guts does not need to make the philosophical calculations as far as fighting Griffith, that goes against the clear humanity of his character: if it were up to Guts, he would do the morally ambiguous wrong thing if it involved killing Griffith and getting his revenge. Guts wont be ethical jesus  because we is not suposed to. In the end, the entire world relies on Guts's hands to be saved from becoming a pile of corpses tall enough for a great liar to reach new heights.
